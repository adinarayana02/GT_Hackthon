# The AI Creative Studio (Hackathon Submission)

## Problem Statement: H-003 | The AI Creative Studio
**Track:** Generative AI & Marketing Tech

### 1. Context & Problem
Businesses spend weeks designing variations of similar image content. Our challenge is to design a system that can automatically generate multiple creative variations for any brand with minimal manual effort.

### 2. The Challenge
- **Input:** Brand logo and product image
- **Process:** Generate 10+ unique ad creative image variations automatically
- **Output:** A zip file with high-resolution images and matching captions

### 3. Technical Overview
- **Image Generation:** Uses Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, or Midjourney APIs (flexible backend)
- **Text Generation:** Ad/Caption content generated via LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere)
- **Packaging:** Bulk-export results as ZIP file for quick download and campaign use

### 4. Workflow Example
1. Upload logo and product.
2. Click generate to produce multiple creative ad variations.
3. Download the full set (images + captions) instantly as a zip.

### 5. Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python / FastAPI backend
- React.js frontend
- OpenAI or HuggingFace for LLM
- Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, etc. for image gen
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 6. Goals & Impact
